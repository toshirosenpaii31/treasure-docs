# treasure-docs

Treasure Docs is the community documentation hub for the Treasure ecosystem. Treasure is building composable economic resources to act as bridges between the growing network of metaverses. Treasure originally began as a complementary addition to the Loot metaverse with composable currencies that adventurers would need in the new metaverse (8 "Treasures" in the form of an NFT). Treasure quickly developed a life of its own and evolved into TreasureDAO, which aims to create a gigaverse based on the interaction between two resources: Treasures and $MAGIC.
