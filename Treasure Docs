# Treasure Docs

## What is Treasure Docs?

Treasure Docs is the community documentation hub for the [Treasure](https://treasure.lol) ecosystem. Treasure began as a free-to-mint Loot derivative that included 8 "Treasures" per NFT. The project has since evolved into TreasureDAO which aims to create a giga-verse based on the interaction between two resources - Treasures and $MAGIC. TreasureDAO and $MAGIC's goals are to be bridges between metaverses, becoming the base layer of disparate universes, powering and connecting them. $MAGIC is to be the reserve currency of the metaverse, fueling the ecosystem and making its resources productive!
